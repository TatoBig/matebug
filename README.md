## About the project
### Tecnology

<p>
 We utilized Svelte to develop the website, leveraging its powerful capabilities for building interactive user interfaces. Svelte's efficient and declarative approach allowed us to create a seamless and responsive user experience. Furthermore, we chose to host the website on a GitHub repository, leveraging the platform's collaborative features and version control capabilities. By utilizing GitHub, we ensure a streamlined development process, enabling team collaboration, easy deployment, and the ability to track and manage changes effectively. This professional approach guarantees a robust and scalable foundation for our website project.

### Website theme
<p>
It was developed with the aim of providing a solution to a problem or offering up-to-date information for the city of Quetzaltenango. We believe that the best solution would be to provide some basic mathematics information since our goal is for students from both public and private schools and institutes to use this website as an informational resource and engage with it. Additionally, we have included an advanced mathematics section. With this addition, we also aim to attract university students, as the topic of differential equations, for example, can generate interest and further engagement with the website. The inclusion of the basic mathematics section will also serve as a review for the early years of university education.
